## [1.0.1] - 2023-11-01 - Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed

#### Critical Bug: Person Fields Not Saving to Database
- **Issue**: Person form fields (First Name, Last Name, Title, Suffix) were not being properly saved to the database
- **Root Cause**: Server API was using `person_data.dict()` without exclusion parameters, causing Pydantic to include Optional fields as None values
- **Solution**: Updated `/server/api/routes/people.py` to use `person_data.dict(exclude_unset=True, exclude_none=True)`
- **Impact**: All person creation and update operations now properly save all provided fields
- **Files Modified**: `server/api/routes/people.py` (lines 101, 404, 483, 548)

#### SQLite Date Constraint Error
- **Issue**: Server returned 500 error when creating person with date_of_birth due to non-deterministic CHECK constraints
- **Solution**: Removed database-level CHECK constraints using `date('now')`, moved validation to application level
- **Files Modified**: `server/database/models.py`
- **Migration**: Database recreation required to remove problematic constraints

#### Qt Deprecation Warnings
- **Issue**: PySide6/Qt6 showing deprecation warnings for `AA_EnableHighDpiScaling` and `AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps`
- **Solution**: Removed deprecated attributes from `client/main.py` (HiDPI is automatic in Qt6)
- **Files Modified**: `client/main.py`

#### Client Shutdown Error
- **Issue**: "Cannot call None function" error when closing the client application
- **Solution**: Fixed function reference in `client/ui/main_window.py` by wrapping in lambda
- **Files Modified**: `client/ui/main_window.py`

#### Health Endpoint 500 Error
- **Issue**: Health check failing with email uniqueness constraint violations
- **Solution**: Updated `server/database/db.py` to use unique test emails with UUID
- **Files Modified**: `server/database/db.py`

#### Missing Person Data Fields
- **Issue**: `PersonData` model in `shared/api_client.py` was missing many fields causing data loss
- **Solution**: Updated `PersonData` class to include all person fields (title, suffix, mobile, etc.)
- **Files Modified**: `shared/api_client.py`

### Enhanced

#### Debugging and Logging
- Added comprehensive debug logging for person creation and update operations
- Enhanced error messages with specific field information
