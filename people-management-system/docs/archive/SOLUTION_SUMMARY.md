# Solution Summary: Fixed "Illegal Header Value" Error

## Problem
The client was failing with "Illegal header value b'Ultrathink error...'" error because the API key field had been corrupted with multi-line text containing user instructions instead of an actual API key.

## Root Cause
The API key field in the configuration had been populated with:
```
Ultrathink error and fix and test it, use context7, use subagent.
-When i add new person.
    -email address not allow me to entry '.'.
```

This multi-line text with newlines cannot be used in HTTP headers, causing the "Illegal header value" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added API Key Validation
- Created `validate_api_key()` function that checks for:
  - Newlines and carriage returns
  - Control characters
  - Valid length (10-256 characters)
  - Valid format (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, dots only)

### 2. Added API Key Sanitization
- Created `sanitize_api_key()` function to clean up minor issues
- Strips whitespace and removes newlines
- Validates the result

### 3. Integrated Validation Throughout
- **config_service.py**: Validates API keys before saving
- **login_dialog.py**: Validates API keys on input
- **api_client.py**: Validates API keys before making requests
- Auto-clears corrupted keys on startup

### 4. Fixed Other Issues
- Email validator now allows periods (.) in email addresses
- Save button now works correctly
- All async/event loop issues resolved

## Files Modified
- `/client/services/config_service.py` - Added validation functions
- `/client/ui/login_dialog.py` - Added input validation
- `/shared/api_client.py` - Added pre-request validation
- `/client/ui/widgets/person_form.py` - Fixed email validation

## Testing Completed
✅ Original corrupted key is now rejected  
✅ Valid API keys work correctly  
✅ No more "Illegal header value" errors  
✅ Client starts and connects successfully  

## How to Use the Fixed Client

1. **Start the server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   make run-server
   ```

2. **Run the client**:
   ```bash
   make run-client
   ```

3. **Login with**:
   - Server URL: `http://localhost:8000`
   - API Key: `dev-admin-key-12345` (for admin access)
   - OR API Key: `dev-readonly-key-67890` (for read-only access)

4. **The client will now**:
   - Validate the API key format
   - Reject any corrupted keys with newlines
   - Connect successfully with valid keys
   - Allow you to add people with email addresses containing periods

## Available API Keys
- **Admin Access**: `dev-admin-key-12345`
- **Read-Only Access**: `dev-readonly-key-67890`

The system is now fully functional and protected against API key corruption!
