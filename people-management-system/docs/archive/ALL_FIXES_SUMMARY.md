# All Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed: "Cannot call None function" Error on Shutdown

**Problem**: When closing the client, an error occurred because `update_ui_config` was being called immediately rather than passed as a function reference.

**Solution**: Changed in `client/ui/main_window.py`:
```python
# Before:
self.async_helper.call_sync(
    self.config_service.update_ui_config(ui_config),  # Called immediately, returns None
    error_callback=on_error
)

# After:
self.async_helper.call_sync(
    lambda: self.config_service.update_ui_config(ui_config),  # Function reference
    error_callback=on_error
)
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed: First Name and Last Name Not Saving to Database

**Problem**: The `PersonData` model in `shared/api_client.py` was missing many fields that the form was sending, causing data loss.

**Solution**: Updated `PersonData` class to include all fields:
```python
class PersonData(BaseModel):
    """Person data model."""
    
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    email: str
    phone: Optional[str] = None
    mobile: Optional[str] = None
    date_of_birth: Optional[str] = None
    address: Optional[str] = None
    city: Optional[str] = None
    state: Optional[str] = None
    zip_code: Optional[str] = None
    country: Optional[str] = None
    # ... and more fields
```

### 3. ✅ Fixed: Qt DeprecationWarning Messages

**Problem**: PySide6/Qt6 was showing deprecation warnings for `AA_EnableHighDpiScaling` and `AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps`.

**Solution**: Removed deprecated attributes from `client/main.py`:
```python
# Removed these lines (HiDPI is automatic in Qt6):
# QCoreApplication.setAttribute(Qt.AA_EnableHighDpiScaling, True)
# QCoreApplication.setAttribute(Qt.AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps, True)
```

### 4. ✅ Fixed: Health Endpoint 500 Error

**Problem**: The health check was failing because it was trying to create a test Person with a non-unique email.

**Solution**: Updated `server/database/db.py` to use unique test emails:
```python
# Use a unique email to avoid conflicts
import uuid
test_email = f"health_check_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}@test.local"

person = Person(
    first_name="HealthCheck",
    last_name="Test",
    email=test_email
)
```

## Test Results

```
✅ Person Creation: All fields now save correctly
✅ API Connection: Working properly  
✅ No Qt Warnings: Deprecation warnings removed
✅ Clean Shutdown: No more "Cannot call None function" error
⚠️ Health Endpoint: Fixed but requires server restart
```

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. **Restart the server** to apply the health endpoint fix:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart:
   make run-server
   ```

2. **Run the client**:
   ```bash
   make run-client
   ```

3. **Login with**:
   - Server URL: `http://localhost:8000`
   - API Key: `dev-admin-key-12345`
